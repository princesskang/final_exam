		<div class=description>
		<p>
			As a student under BSIT that used to take up STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) during Senior High School, it has been hard to adjust and to adapt from the techy environment.
			Everything I've learned from my freshman year in college until now are what I need to pursue my ambition.
		</p>
		
		<p>
        	College life is truly stressful and tiring. However, I would never forget to enjoy during my free time.
			My family and friends are what keeps me going. They inspire me to continue and achieve my dreams.
			I will forever be thankful for having them in my life.
		</p>

		<p>
			My journey as an aspiring programmer will never end as long as I continue to learn from my lessons and the people around me.
			To be a part of a successful company motivates me to work hard and expand my skills.
